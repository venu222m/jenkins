Hereâ€™s a concrete guide to how Jenkins is used in DevOps/SRE roles, tailored for 3.5+ years of experience, covering:

âœ… Real-time Jenkins responsibilities

ðŸ§° CLI commands and usage

ðŸ’¡ Use cases

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Q&A

âœ… Real-Time Jenkins Tasks in DevOps/SRE
Responsibility	Description
CI/CD Pipelines	Automate build, test, and deployment
SCM Integration	Connect to GitHub, Azure Repos, Bitbucket
Docker/K8s Integration	Build Docker images, deploy to Kubernetes
Trigger Jobs	On push, merge, or PR
Notifications	Configure Slack, email alerts
Artifact Handling	Upload artifacts to Nexus/S3/Artifactory
Environment Promotions	Promote builds across DEV â†’ QA â†’ PROD
Pipeline as Code	Write and manage Jenkinsfile (declarative/ scripted)

ðŸ§° Jenkins CLI Commands
To use the Jenkins CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<jenkins_url> <command>
Command	Purpose
list-jobs	List all Jenkins jobs
build <job>	Trigger job build
get-job <job>	Get job config XML
create-job <job>	Create job from XML
delete-job <job>	Delete a Jenkins job
console <job>	Get console output of a job
install-plugin <plugin>	Install Jenkins plugin

ðŸ’¡ Jenkins Real-Time Use Cases
Use Case	Example
CI/CD Pipeline	Build app â†’ run tests â†’ deploy to Azure/AWS
Docker + Jenkins	Build image, push to ACR/ECR
Terraform Deployments	Automate infra provisioning
Ansible Integration	Run playbooks post-deployment
Monitoring	Auto-restart failed builds
Multi-Branch Pipeline	CI for every feature branch

ðŸ§  Jenkins Top Interview Q&A
âœ… Q1: What is Jenkins?
A:
Jenkins is an open-source CI/CD automation server that enables building, testing, and deploying applications automatically. It supports plugin-based extensions for integrating with tools like Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.

âœ… Q2: What is a Jenkins pipeline?
A:
A pipeline automates the build-test-deploy cycle in Jenkins.

Two types:

Declarative: Structured, easy to understand

Scripted: Based on Groovy, more flexible

âœ… Q3: What is a Jenkinsfile? Give an example.
A:
Jenkinsfile defines pipeline-as-code for versioning and automation.

Example:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Testing...'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploying...'
      }
    }
  }
}
âœ… Q4: What are common triggers in Jenkins?
A:

Git Webhook

Poll SCM

Scheduled builds (H/5 * * * *)

After successful upstream job

Manual trigger

âœ… Q5: How do you integrate Jenkins with Git?
A:

Install Git plugin

In job config â†’ set Git repo URL

Add credentials (SSH key/token)

Use webhooks for automatic triggers

âœ… Q6: How do you handle secrets in Jenkins?
A:

Use Credentials Manager

Inject secrets using withCredentials block

Never hardcode in Jenkinsfile

âœ… Q7: What is a Jenkins Agent/Node?
A:

Jenkins Master: Orchestrates builds

Jenkins Agent (Node): Executes jobs
Agents help scale workloads and isolate environments.

âœ… Q8: Jenkins vs GitHub Actions vs Azure Pipelines?
Feature	Jenkins	GitHub Actions	Azure Pipelines
Hosted	Self-hosted	Cloud-native	Cloud-native
Plugins	Huge ecosystem	Limited	Azure-native
Flexibility	High	Medium	High
Setup Time	More	Less	Medium

âœ… Q9: What is Blue Ocean in Jenkins?
A:
A modern UI for Jenkins that makes visualizing pipelines easier and improves usability for developers.

âœ… Q10: Common Jenkins Pipeline Stages?
plaintext
Copy
Edit
1. Checkout SCM
2. Build (Maven/npm)
3. Unit Testing
4. Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)
5. Docker Build/Push
6. Deploy (Terraform, Ansible, Helm)
7. Notification (Slack/Email)
ðŸ“Œ Jenkins Resume Points for DevOps (3.5+ Yrs)
Developed and managed Jenkins pipelines using Jenkinsfile for build and deployment automation

Integrated Jenkins with GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, and Artifactory

Created parameterized and multi-branch pipelines for CI/CD workflows

Implemented secure secret management via Jenkins credentials store

Managed Jenkins plugins, agents, and job scheduling for scalable automation
